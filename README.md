# SheHacksTeam8Challenge3

A python code for a hangman game for SheHacks created by Team 8.

First, it will prompt (and continue prompting) Player 1 until a valid input has been given for the word to guess and the number of guesses.
Next, Player 2 must attempt to guess the word.

A valid word contains no special characters, numbers, or spaces.
A valid number of guesses contains no special characters, letters, spaces, and it is a whole number above 0.
A valid guess contains no special characters, numbers, or spaces, and is only one letter.

With each valid guess, the guess counter will go down by one.
Any invalid guess will not be counted as a guess.

Both the word and guesses will be converted to lowercase to make the game a bit easier :)

Essentially, just like your go-to hangman game!
